        <h3> What do the results say about me?</h3>
        <p> The Brigs Myer test indicates that I am a campaigner, with an extroverted personality that functions with a large amount of tuition guiding my choises. I fone this rather accurate, as I tend to be the loudest one in the room at most of the time. I have a very extroverted personality, and my energy is often recharged from engaging with other people.</p>
       
        <h3> What do these results mean for my team?</h3>
        <p> The test results reflect my desire for a harmounious work environemnt, I'm used to bringing all parties to the table, and working towards getting everyone on the same side. The intuitive side of me, means that I can usually draw out to engage and share their ideas, and also manage different perosnality conflicts around me.</p>

        <p>These test results reflect my extroverted personality, I do like brain storming and discusions. When i have to write documents, i usually start a a mind map, then transition that to dot points, and then to sentances and paragraphs. The lowest scire was fir tge theorist style, I agree that this would be the least effective learning style for me.</p>

        <p>I'm a team player that works well with others, i like to share ideas and collaborate, which is reflected by my learning style.</p>
